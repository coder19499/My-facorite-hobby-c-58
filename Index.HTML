      <p> I like to play basketball. It's fun to make shots for your team. When you have the ball It's like everyone is trying to get it from you. Well not everyone just the people who are not on your team. But you can always pass it to your teamate. Mostly other teamates of your side make shots some are yours but it's still fun to play basketball. I also like it because of the teamwork you learn how to work with others. I like it when you use team work with others. It makes the game more fun because your using teamwork to win and it also makes it much esaier. so that's my favorite hobby.
